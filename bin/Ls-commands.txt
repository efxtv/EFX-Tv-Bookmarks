#Top commands make life easy
ls -r1 #list files 
ls -R1 #list files recorsively file tree
ls -a #all files and directories including hidden

Here are some additional options that I find useful and interesting:

    View file more detailed way			stat ckacct
    List by file size: 				ls -lSh
    Sort by time and date: 			ls -ltr
    Sort by extension: 				ls -X
    Sort by file size: 				ls -S
    Long format with file size: 		ls -ls
    Long format reverse list: 			ls -r
    List directories only:			ls -d */
    List file owned by 				ls -l | sort -k3 
    List file recently used 			ls -ltu
    List files with absolute path		ls -d "$PWD"/*
    List files recorsively absolute path	find $PWD -type f |grep txt
    						find "$PWD" -type f
    List only the .txt files in the directory:  ls *.txt

ls command using Echo
echo .*   #list dot files
echo *    #list all the files and directories
echo *.*  #list files only
echo /*   #echo entire file system
echo *.txt #print all the text files only
echo "$PWD/"* #list all the directories and file with absolute non redable
_______________________________________________________________
-S Sort by size (largest file first) 
-h option will show you the file sizes in human readable format

    #ls largest files first
    ls -lS
    
    #ls smallest file first using reverse
    ls -lShr
    
    #ls and count number of files
