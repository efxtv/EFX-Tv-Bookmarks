Here is another way of looking at it:

Permissions:

> 400     read by owner (for sshkeys or anything you want to protect+ chown root:root)
> 040     read by group
> 004     read by anybody (other)
> 200     write by owner
> 020     write by group
> 002     write by anybody
> 100     execute by owner
> 010     execute by group
> 001     execute by anybody
> To get a combination, just add them up. For example, to get read, write, execute by owner, read, execute, by group, and execute by anybody, you would add 400+200+100+040+010+001 to give 751.
